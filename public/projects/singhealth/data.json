  "description": "We developed a mobile web application for Singhealth staff to perform audits at retail outlets. The app allows staff to perform audits on the go, and provides a convenient way to record and submit audit reports. I was responsible for developing the frontend and backend of the app. I also wrote the automated UI tests for the app. This app uses a MERNG serverless architecture hosted on Heroku with MongoDB as the database.",
